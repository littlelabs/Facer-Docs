        <h2>Watch Face Quality Checklist</h2>
        <ol>
                <li>All features that are included are working as intended (weather, location, time, step count, battery, etc)</li>
                <li>If your watch face includes the digital version of the time, both 24 and 12 hour time are included using the <code>#Db#</code> tag.</li>
                <li>Dim mode is present and functional</li>
                <li>Dim mode includes the time</li>
                <li>Watch face has both square and round backgrounds</li>
                <li>Your watch face description matches the watch face functionality accurately</li>
<hr>        </ol>

        <h2>Avatars</h2>
        <p>Make sure you have an avatar set, otherwise the default will show. It's a good idea to just have your brand/logo as the image. It also shows up when people view your profile on web and mobile. </p>
        <h3>Mobile</h3>

        <p>Good watch face design typically has a few characteristics, just like app design. They are focused, have a clear hierarchy and have great color harmony. Keep all of those in mind when designing.</p>

  <h2>Watchface Checklist</h2>
  <ul>
<li>Do you have a DIM mode? when DIM mode is active it should be either pure black and pure white to display well on all watchfaces. Here is an example<br>

<strong class="clear">Active mode with full color</strong><br>
<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/DIM active.png" class="medium">

<strong class="clear">Black and white DIM mode</strong><br>
<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/DIM inactive.png" class="medium">
</li>

<li>Dim mode includes the time</li>
<li>Are your fonts readable and big enough?</li>
<li>If itâ€™s analog, is there enough contrast between watch hands and the background?</li>
All features that are included are working as intended (weather, location, time, step count, battery, etc)</li>
<li>If the watchface has digital elements the #Db# tag should be used so that the user can later choose their preference. </li>
<li>If animation is advertised in the product description, it functions as intended/stated</li>
</ul>

<h2>Design specs</h2>
<p>Canvas is 640 x 640px at 72 dpi/ppi. You might also want to consider that some watches have a chin at the bottom which would hide any design elements that would be down there on selected models. 
The editor also gives an option to preview the chin with the leftmost button, which is located right below canvas preview</p>

<p>Make sure you design for both square and circle.</p> 
<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/timeless1.png" class="medium">
<p>You can do this by clicking advanced button on an image layer <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/advanced mode.png"> and then uploading different images for square and circle.</p>
