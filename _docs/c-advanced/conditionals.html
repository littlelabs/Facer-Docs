<p>Conditionals are the most complicated and dynamic way to create a watch face.</p> 

      <p>They take this form:</p>
<p><code>
$ EQUALITY TEST ? EXPRESSION IF TEST IS TRUE : EXPRESSION IF TEST IS FALSE $</code></p>
<p>
The first space is for our equality test, which is going to equal true or false. There are five types of operators available:
</p>
<table class="table">
        <thead>
          <tr>
            <th>OPERATOR</th>
            <th>DEFINITION</th>
            <th>EXAMPLE EXPRESSION</th>
            <th>EXAMPLE OUTPUT</th>
          </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
          <!-- ngRepeat: operator in equalityOperators --><tr ng-repeat="operator in equalityOperators">
            <th>= or ==</th>
            <td>Is equal to</td>
            <td>(1=1) or (1==1)</td>
            <td>true</td>
          </tr><!-- end ngRepeat: operator in equalityOperators --><tr ng-repeat="operator in equalityOperators">
            <th>!=</th>
            <td>Is not equal to</td>
            <td>(1!=0)</td>
            <td>true</td>
          </tr><!-- end ngRepeat: operator in equalityOperators --><tr ng-repeat="operator in equalityOperators">
            <th>&gt;</th>
            <td>Is greater than</td>
            <td>(2&gt;1)</td>
            <td>true</td>
          </tr><!-- end ngRepeat: operator in equalityOperators --><tr ng-repeat="operator in equalityOperators">
            <th>&lt;</th>
            <td>Is less than</td>
            <td>(0&lt;1)</td>
            <td>true</td>
          </tr><!-- end ngRepeat: operator in equalityOperators --><tr ng-repeat="operator in equalityOperators">
            <th>&gt;=</th>
            <td>Is greater than or equal to</td>
            <td>(2&gt;=1)</td>
            <td>true</td>
          </tr><!-- end ngRepeat: operator in equalityOperators --><tr ng-repeat="operator in equalityOperators">
            <th>&lt;=</th>
            <td>Is less than or equal to</td>
            <td>(0&lt;=1)</td>
            <td>true</td>
          </tr><!-- end ngRepeat: operator in equalityOperators -->
        </tbody>
      </table>

      <p>Now let's make our own. We'll fill it in step-by-step. Let's start with a blank slate. All of the those dollar signs and question marks look confusing at first, but you'll get used to them (if you have a programming background, you probably already recognize the ternary operator!):</p>

<p><code>$____________?_:_$</code></p>
<p>
Now let's fill in that spot with a simple example. We're going to make an expression that will make a layer appear only before noon. This expression would be added to the opacity attribute of the layer. We'll use the #Da# and check if it's "AM":</p>

<p><code>
$#Da#==AM?_:_$</code></p>
<p>
Next, we'll fill in the EXPRESSION IF TRUE part of the conditional. When #Da# == "AM" is true, we want our layer to appear, so we'll want the opacity to be 1:</p>

<p><code>$#Da#==AM?1:_$</code></p>

<p>
Lastly, we'll fill in the EXPRESSION IF FALSE part of the conditional. When #Da# == "AM" is false, we want our layer to disppear, so we'll want the opacity to be 0:
</p>
<p><code>
$#Da#==AM?1:0$</code>
</p>
<p>
That's it! You just created your first conditional.</p> 

<p>Now some advice:</p>

<p>Don't use " marks before and after texts used in conditions.</p>
<p>Don't use spaces (" ") before and after part of conditions (wrong: <code>$ #Da# == AM ? 1 : 0 $</code> right: <code>$#Da#==AM?1:0$</code>)</p>
